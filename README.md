# Modeling-Refugee-Immigration-Policies
Optimizes refugee flow using Dijkstra's and Genetic Algorithm

This project was developed collaborately with Sarah Wu and Jennifer Zou.

## Problem Synposis

The full problem document is found [here](2016_ICM_Problem_F.pdf)

During the 2015 refugee crisis, hundreds of thousands of refugees migrated to European countries primarily using six main routes ([Article](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34131911)): 
1. West Mediterranean
2. Central Mediterranean
3. Eastern Mediterranean
4. West Balkans
5. Eastern Borders
6. Albania to Greece

The UN has asked your team, the ICM-RUN (RefUgee aNalytics) to help develop a better understanding of the factors involved with facilitating the movement of refugees from their countries of origin into safe- haven countries.

## Solution

Our team modeled the refugee crisis using an agent-based modeling environment and optimized the refugee flow via a combination of Dijkstra's Algorithm and a Genetic Algorithm.
